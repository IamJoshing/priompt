## Meeting Discussion

**Rebecca:** Good morning everyone. We're here to finalize our Q4 expansion into the Pacific Northwest market. James, let's start with the supply chain readiness assessment.

**James:** We've secured partnerships with three organic farms in Oregon and two in Washington. The cold storage facility in Portland is operational as of last week, with capacity for 15,000 units. However, we're still negotiating with Pacific Fresh Logistics for distribution trucking.

**Carmen:** From a sales perspective, I've had preliminary conversations with Whole Foods Pacific Northwest and New Seasons Market. Both are interested, but they want exclusive product lines that aren't available in our California stores.

**David:** The financial projections look solid if we can maintain our current 42% gross margins. But the exclusive product development Carmen mentioned would require an additional $180,000 in R&D and regulatory compliance costs.

**Rebecca:** What's the timeline on those exclusive products?

**Carmen:** Our food scientists estimate 8-10 weeks for formulation and testing, plus another 6 weeks for FDA organic certification. We're looking at mid-October earliest for shelf availability.

**James:** That's cutting it close for the holiday season launch. If Pacific Fresh Logistics doesn't come through, our backup distributor charges 23% more, which would impact those margin projections significantly.

**David:** We could absorb the higher distribution costs for the first quarter, but we'd need to renegotiate retail pricing by February to maintain profitability.

**Carmen:** I'm confident we can justify a 12-15% price increase to retailers if we position these as premium Pacific Northwest exclusives. The market research shows consumers are willing to pay more for locally-sourced organic products.

**Rebecca:** What about staffing for the new territory?

**Carmen:** I need two additional sales reps and a regional coordinator. The coordinator position is critical - without local market knowledge, we'll struggle with retailer relationships and regulatory compliance.

**James:** We also need a warehouse supervisor in Portland and at least three warehouse staff for the initial volume. The facility management company can provide temporary workers, but we need our own people for quality control.

**David:** That's approximately $320,000 in additional annual payroll costs. We budgeted for $280,000, so we're $40,000 over.

**Rebecca:** Can we phase the hiring? Start with essential positions and add staff as volume grows?

**Carmen:** We could delay one sales rep position until January, but the regional coordinator needs to start immediately. Too much regulatory complexity to manage remotely.

**James:** The warehouse supervisor is non-negotiable. Our quality standards require direct oversight, especially during the launch phase.

**David:** I can find the additional $40,000 by reducing the marketing budget from $150,000 to $110,000 for Q4.

**Rebecca:** That seems reasonable since we're focusing on B2B relationships initially rather than consumer marketing.
