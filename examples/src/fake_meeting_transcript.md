## Meeting Discussion

**Sarah:** Let's start with our Q3 roadmap priorities. Mike, what's the status on the API rate limiting implementation?

**Mike:** We've completed the basic throttling mechanism, but we're seeing some edge cases with burst traffic. The current implementation handles about 80% of scenarios well, but enterprise customers are hitting limits during peak usage.

**Lisa:** From a UX perspective, users aren't getting clear feedback when they hit rate limits. We need better error messaging and maybe a usage dashboard.

**Alex:** I've been testing the current implementation and found three critical bugs. The rate counter resets incorrectly for premium accounts, and there's a memory leak in the throttling service after 6 hours of continuous operation.

**Sarah:** OK, so we need to address the enterprise scaling issue and the UX feedback. Mike, how long would it take to implement a tiered rate limiting system?

**Mike:** Probably 2-3 weeks if we prioritize it. The architecture is mostly there, we just need to add the business logic for different customer tiers.

**Lisa:** I can have the error messaging and usage dashboard designs ready by end of week. We should also consider adding upgrade prompts when users approach their limits.

**Alex:** The memory leak is critical - I wouldn't recommend shipping without fixing that. It's causing service crashes in our staging environment after extended load testing.

**Sarah:** What about the mobile app integration? We promised beta customers that feature for July.

**Mike:** That's blocked on the OAuth 2.0 implementation. The third-party authentication provider is having issues with their sandbox environment. Their support team says it might be another week before they resolve it.

**Lisa:** We could potentially ship the mobile app with basic auth first, then migrate to OAuth later. Not ideal from a security standpoint, but it unblocks the launch timeline.

**Alex:** I'd rather delay than ship with basic auth. Too much risk, and we'd have to manage two authentication systems temporarily.

**Sarah:** Let's table the mobile app discussion. Moving on to the database migration - Alex, any concerns from your testing?

**Alex:** The migration scripts are solid, but we need better rollback procedures. If something goes wrong during the production migration, our current rollback would take 3-4 hours.

**Mike:** I can work on improving the rollback automation. We should also consider doing the migration in smaller batches over several nights instead of one big migration.

**Lisa:** Do we need any user-facing communications about potential downtime?

**Sarah:** Yes, let's plan for that. Alex, can you give us worst-case downtime estimates by Friday?
